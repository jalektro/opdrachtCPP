Program to explore and open partslist for weapons from the Belgium defence. 

This program can only be used for the Belgium defence. 

The porgram opens a fullscreen with all weapons availeble in the Belgium Defence. Here the user can click on the specific wepaon of choice which will open a new page where he can see an exploded view of this specific weapon. 
Now the user can enter a partnumber/partname of a specific part and this will return the page where he can find the specific part. All the information like NSN partnumber, partname is displayed so the user can simply copy this 
information to have an order in the logistic program ILIAS.

The main goald for this program is to have an easy access to all the weapon on one specific place, this could be updated with internet but should also work locally. 
The main goal is to spare time in the field with searching for all parts for different weapons. 

edit: the program as now is not finished for a demo.
